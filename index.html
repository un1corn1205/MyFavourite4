                My Hobby is... ART! I like art because I get to express my imagination through it. My favourite type of art is abstract and pixel art. I also like to paint on canvases. Sketching is also enjoying! I like to sketch potraits of others. I also mentioned something else that I like; Crafting!!! I like to make Origami animals and other things and making models or tiny crafts. It helps me learn and helps my to use my creative skills.

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <h2 class="inspitext">J.K Rowling</h2>
        <p>Even though J.K Rowling isn't a painter or an artist, she is my inspiration. As I read her most famous book series, the Harry Potter Series, I got to learn new words and how to use them in my own writings. J.K Rowling has inspired me to write my own stories which I like to share with my friends.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="inspitext">Malala Yousafzai</h1>
        <p>Malala Yousafzai is also my inspiration. She is a Pakistani activist. In her childhood times, the Taliban took over her country and said that girls like her weren't allowed to go to school. But still Malala fought against the Taliban for girls' rights to edeucation, which teaches girls that you can change the world no matter how young you are.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="inspitext">Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
        <p>Leonardo da Vinci was a famous artist born on April 15, 1452. He was an Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect and engineer. His Last Supper and the Mona Lisa paintings are the widely popular and well-known across the world.</p>
